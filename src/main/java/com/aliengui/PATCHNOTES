    0.1.0.1 Test BasicApp - Proof of Concept
        - Bugfixes
            - Fixed WindowView - View relationship causing unresolvable dependency issue
            (both depend on each other, impossible to create both as each needs the other to exist already)
            - Fixed ColorComponent setColor not checking if previous Color was null before checking if they are equal
            - Fixed Views having default dimensions causing multiple of the same subscriber to the observable dimension
            - Fixed WindowView's null windowView causing update requests to act on null object, instead, extracted into its own method to check
            - Fixed RelativeDimensions not updating the value of that dimension upon creation
            - Fixed abs dimensions causing null pointer exceptions in a windowView with no parent view
            - Fixed method infinite recursion with mouse events firing events to itself
            - Fixed concurrent modification when iterating through a collection using a for each loop
            - Fixed render optimization not working because update requests have not been set to false once processed
            - Fixed flickering when resizing/moving window
            - todo fix windowView not binding to window's dimensions
