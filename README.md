# AlienGUI

Refactored version of the Wordle repo (backend GUI) to implement proper design patterns like MVC, Builder, Observer, Event Listening, Singletons, and more

Should ideally make development less time consuming.

# Planned Features
#### XCode-like GUI construction
#### Builder pattern to simply creation
#### Simplistic design, but heavily customizable


# Dependencies
### JUnit 5
 Used for unit testing, not completely necessary for usage
